In a foreign place, the saving grace was the feeling
That it was a heart that he was stealin'
Oh, he was ready to impress and the fierce excitement
The eyes are bright, he couldn't wait to get away
And I bet that Juliet was just the icing on the cake
Make no mistake, no

And even if somehow we could have
Shown you the place you wanted
Well, I'm sure you could have
Made it that bit better on your own
